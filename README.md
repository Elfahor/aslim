A Shitty Language I Made

This is a simple programming language I made to learn about parsing, interpretation, and (eventually, I haven't got into that yet) compilation.

It currently has a simple REPL, I will add a standard file interpreter.

Example session:
```
> let _x 5
> fun incr _a (add _a 1)
> incr _x
int: 6
> 
```
The language [specification](spec.md) is available.
